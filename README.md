	Cards
		Set width of cards so that four are displayed per row on desktop as per wireframe; tested also setting consistent height, with "Read More" expand for longer content, but decided to allow different heights 
	Images 
		Displayed as backgrounds to div with set width and height for consistency
			Tested background-position center center and top center; top-center seemed more appropriate
	Titles
		Added conditional statement to return "Untitled" for blank array values
	Descriptions
		Decided "description" values in array were not descriptive of the photos, so instead used "date_taken" and "published" values, as they seemed to provide most valuable information
	Notes
		Still don't know why first card displayed is filled with last data in array
